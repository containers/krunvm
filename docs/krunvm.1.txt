=========

NAME
----
krunvm - Create microVMs from OCI images


SYNOPSIS
--------
*krunvm* [_GLOBAL_OPTIONS_] *command*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
krunvm is a CLI utility to create, manage and start microVMs which are
generated from OCI images, providing an interface that resembles
operating on conventional containers.

krunvm uses buildah(1) to download the OCI image and mount it into a
local directory, and libkrun to launch the microVM.

The local directory where the OCI image has been mounted is used as
the root filesystem for the microVM, serviced by a virtio-fs
device/server bundled into libkrun.

krunvm supports mounting additional local directories into the
microVM and exposing ports from the guest to the host (and the
networks connected to it).

Networking to the guest running in the microVM is provided by
either libkrun's TSI (Transparent Socket Impersonation) or PASST.

TSI enables a seamless experience that doesn't require network bridges nor other explicit
network configuration. It only supports impersonating AF_INET SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_STREAM sockets.
This implies it's not possible to communicate outside the VM with raw sockets.

PASST uses virtio-net guest device and sends all traffic to a passt subprocess.
Support of network protocols is therefore dependent on what passt supports.
Note that currently you need to run a DHCP client in the guest to get an IP address.
