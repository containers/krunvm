NAME
----
krunvm-changevm - Change the configuration of a microVM


SYNOPSIS
--------
*krunvm changevm* [_OPTIONS_] _microVM_


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*krunvm changevm* changes the configuration of an existing microVM.

When run without any _OPTIONS_, it displays the current configuration
of the microVM.


OPTIONS
-------
*--remove-ports*::
  Removes all port mappings.

*--remote-volumes*::
  Removes all volume mappings.

*--cpus* _NUM_::
  Changes the number of vCPUs that will be created for this microVM.

*--mem* _NUM_::
  Changes the amount of RAM, in MiB, that will be available to this
  microVM.
+
The memory configured for the microVM will not be reserved
immediately. Instead, it will be provided as the guest demands it, and
both the guest and libkrun (acting as the Virtual Machine Monitor)
will attempt to return as many pages as possible to the host.

*--name* _NAME_::
  Assigns a new name to the microVM.

*-p, --port* _HOST_PORT:GUEST_PORT_::
  Exposes a port in the guest running in the microVM through a port in the host.
+
This option can be specified multiple times to expose as many guest
ports as desired.

*-v, --volume* _HOST_PATH:GUEST_PATH_::
  Makes _HOST_PATH_ visible in the guest running in the microVM through _GUEST_PATH_.
+
This option can be specified multiple times to make more paths in the
host visible in the guest.

*-w, --workdir* _GUEST_PATH_::
  Configures _GUEST_PATH_ as the working directory for the first
  binary executed in the microVM.
+
An empty string ("") tells krunvm to not set a working directory
explicitly, letting libkrun decide which one should be set.

*--net* _NETWORK_MODE_::
  Configures the network connection mode. Supported modes are either PASST or TSI.
